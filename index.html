    <h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
    <h2>By Lewis Carroll</h2>

<section>
<p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p>
      <p>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</p>
<p>All mimsy were the borogoves,</p>
      <p>And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
<p>“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</p>
    <p>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</p>
<p>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun</p>
        <p>The frumious Bandersnatch!”</p>

He took his vorpal sword in hand;
      Long time the manxome foe he sought—
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
      And stood awhile in thought.
    </section>
    <section>
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
      And burbled as it came!
    </section>
    <section>
One, two! One, two! And through and through
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
      He went galumphing back.
    </section>
    <section>
“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
      He chortled in his joy.
